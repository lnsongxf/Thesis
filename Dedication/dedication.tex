\textit{To Nadien, who lifted my spirits more than once over the last four years 
         and was more understanding and patient than anyone could hope for; \\ 
				my mother, as I couldn't have made it here without her love and support; \\
				and Emil, whose laugh carried me through the final stages of this project.\\
