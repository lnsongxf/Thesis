	We find that model-implied inflation expectations can differ substantially
	from break-even inflation rates when market volatility is high. Our
	model's ability to be updated weekly makes it suitable for real-time

	In turn, dynamic term structure models, equipped with stronger economic
	structure, have been mainly adopted to price derivatives and explain
	empirical stylized facts. In this paper, we combine flavors of those
	two classes of models to test whether no-arbitrage affects forecasting.
	We construct cross-sectional (allowing arbitrages) and arbitrage-free
	versions of a parametric polynomial model to analyze how well they
	predict out-of-sample interest rates. Based on US Treasury yield
	data, we find that no-arbitrage restrictions significantly improve
	forecasts. Arbitrage-free versions achieve overall smaller biases
	and root mean square errors for most maturities and forecasting horizons.
	Furthermore, a decomposition of forecasts into forward-rates and
	holding return premia indicates that the superior performance of
	no-arbitrage versions is due to a better identification of bond risk
	premium.},

	almost no effect on the nominal yields; that is, the latent factor
	is hidden. We show that this hidden factor is not related to either

  abstract = {{<p>Winner of the prestigious Paul A. Samuelson Award for scholarly
	writing on lifelong financial security, John Cochrane's Asset Pricing
	now appears in a revised edition that unifies and brings the science
	of asset pricing up to date for advanced students and professionals.
	Cochrane traces the pricing of all assets back to a single idea--price
	equals expected discounted payoff--that captures the macro-economic
	risks underlying each security's value. By using a single, stochastic
	discount factor rather than a separate set of tricks for each asset
	class, Cochrane builds a unified account of modern asset pricing.
	He presents applications to stocks, bonds, and options. Each model--consumption
	based, CAPM, multifactor, term structure, and option pricing--is
	derived as a different specification of the discounted factor.</p><p>The
	discount factor framework also leads to a state-space geometry for
	mean-variance frontiers and asset pricing models. It puts payoffs
	in different states of nature on the axes rather than mean and variance
	of return, leading to a new and conveniently linear geometrical representation
	of asset pricing ideas.</p><p>Cochrane approaches empirical work
	with the Generalized Method of Moments, which studies sample average
	prices and discounted payoffs to determine whether price does equal
	expected discounted payoff. He translates between the discount factor,
	GMM, and state-space language and the beta, mean-variance, and regression
	language common in empirical work and earlier theory.</p><p>The book
	also includes a review of recent empirical work on return predictability,
	value and other puzzles in the cross section, and equity premium
	puzzles and their resolution. Written to be a summary for academics
	and professionals as well as a textbook, this book condenses and
	advances recent scholarship in financial economics.</p>}},

	focuses on time-series dynamics (primarily those of the instantaneous

	Instead, we use variations on the Nelson-Siegel exponential components
	framework to model the entire yield curve, period-by-period, as a
	three-dimensional parameter evolving dynamically. We show that the
	three time-varying parameters may be interpreted as factors corresponding
	to level, slope and curvature, and that they may be estimated with
	high efficiency. We propose and estimate autoregressive models for
	the factors, and we show that our models are consistent with a variety

  abstract = {Discrete time stochastic volatility models (hereafter SVOL) are noticeably
	harder to estimate than the successful ARCH family of models. In
	this paper, we develop methods for finite sample inference, smoothing,
	and prediction for a number of univariate and multivariate SVOL models.
	Specifically, we model fat-tailed and skewed conditional distributions,
	correlated errors distributions (leverage effect), and two multivariate
	models, a stochastic factor structure model and a stochastic discount
	dynamic model. We specify the models as a hierarchy of conditional
	probability distributions: p(data/volatilities), p(volatilities/
	parameters) and p(parameters). This hierarchy provides a natural
	environment for the construction of stochastic volatility models
	that depart from standard distributional assumptions. Given a model
	and the data, inference and prediction are based on the joint posterior
	distribution of the volatilities and the parameters which we simulate
	via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Our approach also provides
	a sensitivity analysis for parameter inference and an outlier diagnostic.
	Our framework, therefore, provides a general perspective on specification
	and implementation of stochastic volatility models. We apply various
	extensions of the basic SVOL model to many financial time series.
	We find strong evidence of non-normal conditional distributions for
	stock returns and exchange rates. We also find some evidence of correlated
	errors for stock returns. These departures from the basic model affect
	persistence and therefore should be incorporated if the model is
	used for variance prediction. Les modèles de volatilité stochastique

	conditional forecasts of the pricing factors are invariant to the
	imposition of no-arbitrage restrictions. This invariance is maintained
	even in the presence of a variety of restrictions on the factor structure
	of bond yields. To establish these results, we develop a novel canonical
	GDTSM in which the pricing factors are observable portfolios of yields.
	For our normalization, standard maximum likelihood algorithms converge
	to the global optimum almost instantaneously. We present empirical
	estimates and out-of-sample forecasts for several GDTSMs using data
